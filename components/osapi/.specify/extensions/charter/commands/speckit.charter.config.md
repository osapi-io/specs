# Charter Configuration

Configure the charter fragment registry and select which fragments to include in the project constitution.

## User Input

$ARGUMENTS

## Prerequisites

1. Spec Kit must be initialized in the project (`specify init` has been run)
2. A charter registry must be accessible (local directory or git repository)

## Steps

### Step 1: Determine Registry

The registry is the source of constitution fragments. It can be a local directory or a git repository.

1. Check if a charter configuration already exists by running:

```bash
bash .specify/extensions/charter/scripts/bash/registry-default.sh "$(pwd)"
```

It prints `EXISTING_CONFIG=true|false` and a `registry: <value>` line (the
existing registry, or the default `.charter` proposal).

2. Present the current registry setting to the user:

   - If a config already exists, show: `Current registry: <value>. Confirm or enter a new value.`
   - If no config exists, show: `Default registry: .charter (relative to project root). Confirm or enter a new value.`

3. The user can:
   - **Confirm** the current/default value (press Enter, say "yes", "ok", "confirm", etc.)
   - **Provide a new value**: a relative path, absolute path, or git URL (SSH or HTTPS)

4. Once the registry value is determined, write the configuration:

```bash
bash .specify/extensions/charter/scripts/bash/config-write.sh "<REGISTRY_VALUE>" "$(pwd)"
```

### Step 2: Validate Registry

Fetch and validate the registry. The script clones/refreshes git registries,
resolves the local path, and verifies the structure (`manifest.yml` present with
required `version` and `name` fields):

```bash
bash .specify/extensions/charter/scripts/bash/registry-validate.sh "$(pwd)"
```

On success it prints `VALID` along with `name=` and `version=`. On failure it
prints the error to stderr and exits non-zero.

**If validation fails**: Display the error message to the user and invite them to re-run `/speckit.charter.config` with a valid registry. **Stop execution here.**

**If validation succeeds**: Proceed to Step 2b.

### Step 2b: Detect Distributed Sub-Constitutions (monorepo)

Distributed sub-constitutions let each package in a monorepo own its rules in a
`<package>/.charter/constitution.md` file (see the Notes section). Detect them
and let the user enable the feature.

1. Search for distributed sub-constitutions (recursive, up to 5 package levels):

```bash
bash .specify/extensions/charter/scripts/bash/distributed-detect.sh "$(pwd)"
```

Each output line is a package path (the directory containing a `.charter/constitution.md`), relative to the project root.

2. **If one or more were found**, display them:

```
Distributed sub-constitutions found:
  packages/front
  packages/back
```

If none were found, do not display the list.

3. **In all cases** (found or not), ask the user whether to enable distributed
   sub-constitutions:

```
Enable distributed sub-constitutions? (yes/no) [default: no]
```

4. Persist the choice in the config:
   - If the user answers **yes**:

```bash
bash .specify/extensions/charter/scripts/bash/config-distributed-set.sh true "$(pwd)"
```

   - If the user answers **no** (or presses Enter for the default):

```bash
bash .specify/extensions/charter/scripts/bash/config-distributed-set.sh false "$(pwd)"
```

The flag is stored as `distributed_sub_constitutions` in
`.specify/charter/config.yml` (default `false`).

### Step 3: List Available Fragments

Enumerate all available fragments and sub-constitutions, detect any existing
local constitution, and — when distributed sub-constitutions are enabled —
detect the distributed sub-constitutions.

```bash
# Fragments + sub-constitutions, tab-separated: TYPE<TAB>CATEGORY<TAB>PATH<TAB>NAME
# TYPE is one of: mandatory_fragment | recommended_fragment | fragment | sub-constitution
bash .specify/extensions/charter/scripts/bash/fragment-list.sh "$(pwd)"

# Distributed sub-constitutions (only relevant when the feature is enabled).
# One package path per line.
bash .specify/extensions/charter/scripts/bash/distributed-detect.sh "$(pwd)"

# Detect an existing local constitution.
# Exit code: 0 = placeholder (skip), 1 = usable constitution, 2 = no file.
bash .specify/extensions/charter/scripts/bash/constitution-is-placeholder.sh
echo "placeholder_check_exit=$?"
```

`fragment-list.sh` already tags mandatory and recommended fragments via the
`TYPE` column (read from the registry `manifest.yml`), so no separate manifest
parsing is needed. Treat the local constitution as selectable only when
`constitution-is-placeholder.sh` exits with code `1` (usable, not a placeholder).
Include distributed sub-constitutions in the selection list **only when
`distributed_sub_constitutions` is `true`** in the config.

### Step 4: Present Selection List

Using the data from Step 3, build and present a numbered selection list to the user following this structure:

**Use the `TYPE` column** from `fragment-list.sh` to identify mandatory and
recommended fragments (no separate manifest parsing needed).

**Source tags** — every selectable item is prefixed with its source:
- `|R|` — comes from the **Registry** (fragments and registry sub-constitutions)
- `|L|` — comes **Locally** from the project (distributed sub-constitutions and
  the current project constitution)

**Build the selection list** in this exact order:

```
[FRAGMENTS]
<mandatory fragments — NO number, |R|, marked (MANDATORY)>
<recommended fragments — numbered, |R|, marked (RECOMMENDED)>
<regular fragments — numbered, |R|>
[SUB-CONSTITUTIONS]
<registry sub-constitutions — numbered, |R|>
<distributed sub-constitutions — numbered, |L|, marked (detected)>   ← only if enabled
[OTHER]
<CURRENT PROJECT CONSTITUTION — numbered, |L|, only if a usable constitution exists>
```

**Rules:**
- **Mandatory fragments** are listed first WITHOUT a number, tagged `|R|`, and marked `(MANDATORY)`. They are always included — the user cannot deselect them.
- **Recommended fragments** are listed next WITH numbers, tagged `|R|`, and marked `(RECOMMENDED)`. They are selectable.
- **Regular fragments** are listed after recommended, WITH numbers, tagged `|R|`.
- **Registry sub-constitutions** are listed under a `[SUB-CONSTITUTIONS]` header, WITH numbers, tagged `|R|`.
- **Distributed sub-constitutions** (only when `distributed_sub_constitutions` is enabled) are listed right after the registry sub-constitutions, WITH numbers, tagged `|L|`, and marked `(detected)`. Their name is the package path (e.g. `packages/back`).
- If a **local constitution** exists AND is NOT a placeholder template (see Step 3), add it under an `[OTHER]` header as `<CURRENT PROJECT CONSTITUTION>` WITH a number, tagged `|L|`. It is selectable.
- A constitution is considered a placeholder if it contains bracket-style placeholder tokens like `[PROJECT_NAME]`, `[PRINCIPLE_1_NAME]`, `[CONSTITUTION_VERSION]`, etc. Placeholder files are NOT offered in the selection list.
- Numbering is sequential starting at 1, across all selectable items (recommended, regular fragments, registry sub-constitutions, distributed sub-constitutions, and current constitution share the same numbering).
- Always print the `Sources:` legend at the bottom.

**Example output to show the user:**

```
[FRAGMENTS]
   |R| (MANDATORY) global/compliance
   |R| (MANDATORY) global/security
1. |R| (RECOMMENDED) global/code-quality
2. |R| (RECOMMENDED) languages/typescript/standards
3. |R| domains/finance/regulations
4. |R| domains/ecommerce/checkout
5. |R| languages/python/style
[SUB-CONSTITUTIONS]
6. |R| package_auth
7. |R| package_api
8. |L| packages/front (detected)
9. |L| packages/back (detected)
[OTHER]
10. |L| <CURRENT PROJECT CONSTITUTION>

Sources:
[R]: Registry
[L]: Local
```

### Step 5: Collect User Selection

Ask the user to select items by number. Accepted formats:
- Space-separated: `1 2 3 4`
- Comma-separated: `1, 2, 3`
- Dot-separated: `1. 2. 3.`
- Range expressions: `from 3 to 6 plus 8` or `1-4, 7`

Parse the user's selection and combine with mandatory fragments to build the complete section list.

**CRITICAL**: Only items whose numbers appear in the user's selection are included. If `<CURRENT PROJECT CONSTITUTION>` has number N and N is NOT in the user's selection, it must NOT be included in the composition. The same applies to any fragment, sub-constitution, or distributed sub-constitution — only selected numbers are included.

### Step 6: Save Composition State

Build the composition state and write it to `.specify/charter/state.yml`.

The YAML structure is:

```yaml
# Charter composition state
# Generated by /speckit.charter.config
# Last configured: <CURRENT_ISO_DATE>

fragments:
  - "<fragment_name_1>"
  - "<fragment_name_2>"
  - "<fragment_name_3>"

sub_constitutions:
  - "<sub_constitution_name_1>"
  - "<sub_constitution_name_2>"

distributed_sub_constitutions:
  - "<package_path_1>"
  - "<package_path_2>"

local_constitution: true  # or false
local_constitution_content: |
  <LOCAL CONSTITUTION CONTENT WITHOUT SPECKIT METADATA>
```

**Rules for the lists:**
- `sub_constitutions` holds the selected **registry** sub-constitutions as `sub-constitutions/<filename_without_md>` (e.g. `sub-constitutions/packages_auth`). The `sub-constitutions/` prefix is part of the stored ID.
- `distributed_sub_constitutions` holds the selected **distributed** sub-constitutions as `<package_path>/.charter/constitution` (e.g. `packages/auth/.charter/constitution`). This encodes the full source path without the `.md` extension.
- Include `distributed_sub_constitutions` only when the feature is enabled and the user selected one or more; otherwise write it as an empty list (`distributed_sub_constitutions: []`) or omit it.

**Rules for `local_constitution_content`:**
- Only present if `local_constitution: true` (the user selected
  `<CURRENT PROJECT CONSTITUTION>`).
- Obtain the stripped content (Sync Impact Report header and the
  `Version/Ratified/Last Amended` footer removed) with:

```bash
bash .specify/extensions/charter/scripts/bash/constitution-strip-local.sh
```

Write the assembled YAML to the state file (the script reads the content from
stdin):

```bash
bash .specify/extensions/charter/scripts/bash/state-write.sh "$(pwd)" << 'STATEEOF'
<GENERATED_YAML_CONTENT>
STATEEOF
```

### Step 7: Show Composition Summary

Present the final composition for information. **Do NOT ask for confirmation** —
the only inputs this command requests are the registry value (Step 1) and the
fragment selection (Step 5).

Compute the total size (reads the just-saved state, sums all selected fragment
content plus the local constitution):

```bash
bash .specify/extensions/charter/scripts/bash/compose-size-check.sh "$(pwd)"
```

This outputs `TOTAL_BYTES=<n>` and `EXCEEDS_32K=true|false`.

Display the summary in this format:

```
========= FINAL PROJECT CONSTITUTION =========
[FRAGMENT] |R| <fragment_name_1>
[FRAGMENT] |R| <fragment_name_2>
[SUB-CONSTITUTION] |R| <sub_constitution_name_1>
[SUB-CONSTITUTION] |L| <package_path_1>
[OTHER] |L| <CURRENT PROJECT CONSTITUTION>
===============================================

Sources:
[R]: Registry
[L]: Local
```

**Rules for the summary:**
- Each line is tagged with its source: `|R|` for registry items (fragments and
  registry sub-constitutions) and `|L|` for local items (distributed
  sub-constitutions and the current project constitution).
- `[FRAGMENT]` lines list the selected fragments (mandatory fragments always
  appear; other fragments appear only if their number was selected).
- `[SUB-CONSTITUTION]` lines list selected registry sub-constitutions (`|R|`)
  and selected distributed sub-constitutions (`|L|`, shown by package path).
- The `[OTHER] |L| <CURRENT PROJECT CONSTITUTION>` line is shown ONLY if the user
  selected the number assigned to `<CURRENT PROJECT CONSTITUTION>`. If not
  selected, this line MUST NOT appear.
- Do NOT show the content of the constitution — only the labels.
- Each `[FRAGMENT]` line shows the fragment name as it appears in the registry
  (path without `.md`). Each registry `[SUB-CONSTITUTION]` line shows the
  sub-constitution name; each distributed `[SUB-CONSTITUTION]` line shows the
  package path.
- Always print the `Sources:` legend at the bottom.

**Size warning:** If `EXCEEDS_32K=true`, add this warning:

```
⚠️ The total constitution length will exceed 32 KiB:
Critical information may be overlooked by the agent, and unnecessary tokens increase inference cost.
```

### Step 8: Display Final Message

After saving the state, display:

```
✅ Composed constitution settings saved.

⚠️  IMPORTANT: Your project constitution has not changed yet.
    To apply this composition, run /speckit.charter.compose
```

## Notes

- The registry can be changed at any time by re-running `/speckit.charter.config`.
- Fragment names correspond to their file paths within the registry's `fragments/` directory, without the `.md` extension (e.g., `languages/typescript/standards`).
- Registry sub-constitution IDs are stored as `sub-constitutions/<filename_without_md>` (e.g., `sub-constitutions/packages_auth`). The `sub-constitutions/` prefix is part of the ID and enables typed section markers in the composed constitution.
- Distributed sub-constitution IDs are stored as `<package_path>/.charter/constitution` (e.g., `packages/auth/.charter/constitution`). The full source path (minus `.md`) is the ID.
- Git registries are cloned/fetched into `.specify/charter/.cache/registry/` and use the default branch.
- Git authentication uses the local system credentials (SSH keys, credential helpers) — no additional authentication is required.

### Distributed sub-constitutions (monorepos)

- Distributed sub-constitutions are for **monorepos** where each package keeps
  its own rules next to its code, in a `<package>/.charter/constitution.md` file.
- They differ from **registry sub-constitutions**, which live centrally in the
  registry's `sub-constitutions/` directory. Use registry sub-constitutions when
  you prefer NOT to store package rules inside the packages; use distributed
  sub-constitutions when package owners should maintain their own rules in-tree.
- Detection only matches files inside a `.charter` folder
  (`<package>/.charter/constitution.md`). This deliberately ignores a package's
  own Spec Kit constitution (e.g. `<package>/.specify/memory/constitution.md`)
  to avoid conflicts when Spec Kit is used both at the monorepo root and inside
  individual packages, and to avoid interfering with future evolution of the
  Spec Kit constitution file.
- The ID of a distributed sub-constitution stored in state is its full source path relative to the project root, without `.md` (e.g. `packages/back/.charter/constitution`). The `WHEN WORKING ON` prefix line in the composed constitution uses only the package root path (e.g. `packages/back`).
- Distributed (and registry) sub-constitutions are **cacheless**: their latest
  on-disk content is read on every `/speckit.charter.compose`, so package owners
  can update rules without any snapshot/update step.
