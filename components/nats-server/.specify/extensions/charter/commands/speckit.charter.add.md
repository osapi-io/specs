# Charter Add

Add a new fragment or sub-constitution from the registry to the current composition state and rebuild the constitution.

## User Input

$ARGUMENTS

The argument MAY be the name of a fragment, registry sub-constitution, or distributed sub-constitution to add (e.g., `global/code-quality`, `packages_auth`, `packages/back`). If not provided, the user will be asked to select from available options.

## Prerequisites

1. Charter must be configured — `.specify/charter/state.yml` must exist (run `/speckit.charter.config` first)
2. The registry must be accessible

## Steps

### Step 1: Validate State

```bash
bash .specify/extensions/charter/scripts/bash/state-check.sh "$(pwd)"
```

If the output is `STATE_EXISTS=false`, the charter is not configured — display the
error below and stop:

```
❌ ERROR: No charter configuration found.
Run /speckit.charter.config first to configure the registry and select fragments.
```

### Step 2: Resolve Registry and List Available Fragments

```bash
echo "=== ALL REGISTRY FRAGMENTS & SUB-CONSTITUTIONS ==="
# Tab-separated: TYPE<TAB>CATEGORY<TAB>PATH<TAB>NAME
# TYPE = mandatory_fragment | recommended_fragment | fragment | sub-constitution
bash .specify/extensions/charter/scripts/bash/fragment-list.sh "$(pwd)"

echo "=== DISTRIBUTED SUB-CONSTITUTIONS (only relevant when enabled) ==="
# One package path per line (e.g. packages/back)
bash .specify/extensions/charter/scripts/bash/distributed-detect.sh "$(pwd)"
```

The currently selected fragments, sub-constitutions, and distributed
sub-constitutions were already printed by `state-check.sh` in Step 1 (the
`fragments:`, `sub_constitutions:`, and `distributed_sub_constitutions:` lists in
the state). Distributed sub-constitutions are only offered when
`distributed_sub_constitutions` is `true` in the config.

### Step 3: Present Available (Not Yet Selected) Fragments

From the output of Step 2, compute the **difference** between all available items and currently selected items. Only items NOT already in the state are available for addition.

Build a numbered selection list of available items, tagged by source (`|R|`
registry, `|L|` local):

```
Available items to add:
[FRAGMENTS]
1. |R| global/security
2. |R| domains/finance/regulations
3. |R| languages/python/style
[SUB-CONSTITUTIONS]
4. |R| package_monitoring
5. |R| package_logging
6. |L| packages/back (detected)

Sources:
[R]: Registry
[L]: Local
```

**Rules:**
- Only show items that are NOT already in the state file (neither in `fragments`, `sub_constitutions`, nor `distributed_sub_constitutions` lists)
- Number sequentially starting at 1
- Group by type: fragments first, then sub-constitutions (registry `|R|` then distributed `|L|`)
- Distributed sub-constitutions appear only when the feature is enabled

If the argument already specifies a valid name that is NOT in the current state, skip the selection list and use that name directly. A registry sub-constitution is referenced by its filename stem (e.g. `packages_auth`); a distributed sub-constitution is referenced by its package path (e.g. `packages/back`). Both are converted to their full state IDs before being written to state (see Step 6).

If the argument specifies a name that is ALREADY in the state, display:

```
❌ ERROR: "<NAME>" is already in the current composition.
Current fragments: <list>
Current sub-constitutions: <list>
Current distributed sub-constitutions: <list>
```

If no items are available (all registry items are already selected), display:

```
ℹ️  All available fragments from the registry are already in the composition.
```

### Step 4: Ask User to Select Fragment

If no valid argument was provided, ask the user to select from the numbered list:

```
Select the fragment to add (enter number or name):
```

The user can provide either a number from the list or the full fragment name.

Validate the selection:
- If a number: must be within the displayed range
- If a name: must match an available (not yet selected) fragment/sub-constitution from the registry

### Step 5: Ask for Position

Once the fragment is identified, determine where to place it in the composition.

Display the current composition order:

```
Current composition order:
1. global/compliance (fragment)
2. global/code-quality (fragment)
3. languages/typescript/standards (fragment)
4. packages_auth (registry sub-constitution)
5. packages/back (distributed sub-constitution)
6. <CURRENT PROJECT CONSTITUTION>

Where should "<NEW_ITEM>" be placed?
(Examples: "after 2", "before 3", "between 1 and 2", "at the end", "after global/code-quality")
Default: at the end (before local constitution if present)
```

**Rules for the position display:**
- Show all fragments in order from the state file, numbered sequentially
- Show all registry sub-constitutions, then distributed sub-constitutions, after fragments, continuing the numbering
- If `local_constitution: true`, show `<CURRENT PROJECT CONSTITUTION>` as the last item
- The local constitution is ALWAYS the last section — the new item cannot be placed after it

**Parse the user's position response:**
- `"after N"` or `"after <name>"` — insert after position N or after the named item
- `"before N"` or `"before <name>"` — insert before position N or before the named item
- `"between N and M"` or `"between <name1> and <name2>"` — insert between those positions
- `"at the end"`, `"end"`, `"last"`, or empty/default — append at the end of the appropriate list (fragments or sub-constitutions), but always before the local constitution
- `"at the beginning"`, `"first"`, `"start"` — insert at position 1

**CRITICAL**: The local constitution (`<!-- [PROJECT SPECIFIC] SECTION -->`) is ALWAYS the very last section in the final constitution. No fragment or sub-constitution can be placed after it. If the user requests a position after the local constitution, respond:

```
⚠️ The local constitution is always the last section. Placing "<NEW_FRAGMENT>" just before it instead.
```

**Position resolution logic:**
- Fragments are inserted into the `fragments` list in state.yml
- Registry sub-constitutions are inserted into the `sub_constitutions` list in state.yml
- Distributed sub-constitutions are inserted into the `distributed_sub_constitutions` list in state.yml
- The position number maps to the combined ordered list (fragments, then registry sub-constitutions, then distributed sub-constitutions)
- When inserting a fragment, compute the index within the `fragments` array
- When inserting a registry sub-constitution, compute the index within the `sub_constitutions` array
- When inserting a distributed sub-constitution, compute the index within the `distributed_sub_constitutions` array

### Step 6: Update State File

Add the new item to the state file at the determined position.

1. Read the current state
2. Convert the user-facing name to the full state ID:
   - Fragment: use the registry path as-is (e.g. `global/code-quality`)
   - Registry sub-constitution: prefix with `sub-constitutions/` (e.g. `packages_auth` → `sub-constitutions/packages_auth`)
   - Distributed sub-constitution: append `/.charter/constitution` (e.g. `packages/back` → `packages/back/.charter/constitution`)
3. Insert the full state ID at the correct position in the appropriate list (`fragments`, `sub_constitutions`, or `distributed_sub_constitutions`)
4. Write the updated state back

Write the updated YAML to `.specify/charter/state.yml`.

### Step 7: Fetch and Save Snapshot (fragments only)

Only **fragments** are snapshotted. Registry sub-constitutions and distributed
sub-constitutions are cacheless — do NOT save snapshots for them; their content
is re-read fresh during composition.

```bash
FRAG_NAME="<NEW_ITEM_NAME>"
TYPE="<TYPE>"   # fragment | sub-constitution | distributed

if [[ "$TYPE" == "fragment" ]]; then
  bash .specify/extensions/charter/scripts/bash/snapshot-save.sh "$FRAG_NAME" "fragment" "$(pwd)"
  echo "CONTENT:"
  bash .specify/extensions/charter/scripts/bash/fragment-read.sh "$FRAG_NAME" "fragment" "$(pwd)"
elif [[ "$TYPE" == "sub-constitution" ]]; then
  echo "CONTENT (cacheless — read fresh at compose):"
  bash .specify/extensions/charter/scripts/bash/fragment-read.sh "$FRAG_NAME" "sub-constitution" "$(pwd)"
else # distributed
  echo "CONTENT (cacheless — read fresh at compose):"
  bash .specify/extensions/charter/scripts/bash/distributed-read.sh "$FRAG_NAME" "$(pwd)"
fi
```

### Step 8: Recompose Constitution

Invoke `/speckit.charter.compose` to rebuild the constitution with the newly added fragment at the correct position.

This ensures the constitution file is regenerated consistently using the same composition pipeline.

### Step 9: Display Result

```
✅ Fragment "<NEW_FRAGMENT_NAME>" added to the composition at position <POSITION>.
   The constitution has been regenerated.

Current composition:
  1. <fragment_1>
  2. <fragment_2>
  ...
  N. <CURRENT PROJECT CONSTITUTION>
```

## Notes

- Adding an item updates both the state file and the actual constitution (via recomposition)
- The local constitution is always the last section — new items are placed before it by default
- If the item is already in the composition, the command refuses and suggests using `/speckit.charter.compose update <name>` instead (only relevant for fragments; sub-constitutions are always refreshed on compose)
- Distributed sub-constitutions (package paths like `packages/back`) can be added only when the feature is enabled in the config; the state stores them as `packages/back/.charter/constitution`
- Registry sub-constitutions are displayed to the user by their filename stem (e.g. `packages_auth`) but stored in state as `sub-constitutions/packages_auth`
- Fragments are snapshotted; registry and distributed sub-constitutions are cacheless and read fresh at compose time
- A backup of the previous constitution is created automatically during recomposition
- The position is determined by the combined order of fragments + registry sub-constitutions + distributed sub-constitutions in the state file
