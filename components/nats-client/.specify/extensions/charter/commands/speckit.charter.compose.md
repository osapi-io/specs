# Charter Compose

Compose the project constitution from the configured charter fragments and invoke `/speckit.constitution` to generate the final file.

## User Input

$ARGUMENTS

Parse arguments for:
- `update` — Update mode: only refresh fragments from the registry without overriding local modifications. Can optionally be followed by a fragment name to update a single fragment: `update <FRAGMENT_NAME>`
- No arguments — Full compose (creation or recreation mode)

## Prerequisites

1. Spec Kit must be initialized in the project
2. Charter should be configured — `.specify/charter/state.yml` should exist. If it does **not** exist (the user never ran `/speckit.charter.config`), this command runs an inline configuration flow first (see **Step 1**), so a single `/speckit.charter.compose` invocation both configures and composes.

## Steps

### Step 1: Validate State (with inline configuration fallback)

```bash
bash .specify/extensions/charter/scripts/bash/state-check.sh "$(pwd)"
```

**If the state file exists (`STATE_EXISTS=true`):** the charter is already
configured. Proceed directly to **Step 2**.

**If the state file does NOT exist (`STATE_EXISTS=false`):** the user is running
`/speckit.charter.compose` without ever having run `/speckit.charter.config`.
Instead of stopping, run the inline configuration flow below (Step 1a) to
configure the charter and then continue seamlessly into the composition. This
lets a single `/speckit.charter.compose` invocation configure **and** compose in
one pass.

> This fallback requires two inputs from the user, exactly like
> `/speckit.charter.config`:
> 1. **The registry value** — the flow asks for it (offering the current/default
>    `.charter` as the proposed value); it does NOT silently accept the default.
> 2. **The fragment selection.**
>
> After the selection, the flow displays the composition summary **for
> information only — no confirmation is requested** — and proceeds automatically
> all the way to generating the final constitution.

#### Step 1a: Inline Configuration Flow

This flow mirrors `/speckit.charter.config` (Steps 1–7) but **skips the final
yes/no/cancel confirmation** — after the fragment selection the summary is shown
for information and the flow continues automatically.

**1a.1 — Determine and validate the registry**

Ask the user for the registry value (this is a required input, just like the
standalone config command — do not skip it). Check for an existing registry
configuration to propose as the default; otherwise propose `.charter`:

```bash
bash .specify/extensions/charter/scripts/bash/registry-default.sh "$(pwd)"
```

Present the current/default registry to the user and let them confirm it or
enter a new value (relative path, absolute path, or git URL). Then write the
configuration:

```bash
bash .specify/extensions/charter/scripts/bash/config-write.sh "<REGISTRY_VALUE>" "$(pwd)"
```

Validate the registry (clones/refreshes git registries, resolves the local path,
and checks `manifest.yml` and its required fields):

```bash
bash .specify/extensions/charter/scripts/bash/registry-validate.sh "$(pwd)"
```

If validation fails (non-zero exit), display the error and stop. If it succeeds,
continue.

**1a.2 — Detect and enable distributed sub-constitutions (monorepo)**

Detect distributed sub-constitutions (each is a `<package>/.charter/constitution.md`
file, recursive up to 5 package levels) and let the user enable the feature:

```bash
bash .specify/extensions/charter/scripts/bash/distributed-detect.sh "$(pwd)"
```

If one or more are found, display them:

```
Distributed sub-constitutions found:
  packages/front
  packages/back
```

In all cases (found or not), ask whether to enable the feature
(`Enable distributed sub-constitutions? (yes/no) [default: no]`) and persist the
choice:

```bash
# yes:
bash .specify/extensions/charter/scripts/bash/config-distributed-set.sh true "$(pwd)"
# no (or default):
bash .specify/extensions/charter/scripts/bash/config-distributed-set.sh false "$(pwd)"
```

**1a.3 — List available fragments**

Enumerate fragments, sub-constitutions, distributed sub-constitutions (when
enabled), and detect any existing non-placeholder local constitution:

```bash
# Fragments + sub-constitutions, tab-separated: TYPE<TAB>CATEGORY<TAB>PATH<TAB>NAME
bash .specify/extensions/charter/scripts/bash/fragment-list.sh "$(pwd)"

# Distributed sub-constitutions (only relevant when enabled). One path per line.
bash .specify/extensions/charter/scripts/bash/distributed-detect.sh "$(pwd)"

# Detect an existing local constitution.
# Exit code: 0 = placeholder (skip), 1 = usable, 2 = no file.
bash .specify/extensions/charter/scripts/bash/constitution-is-placeholder.sh
echo "placeholder_check_exit=$?"
```

The `TYPE` column from `fragment-list.sh` identifies mandatory and recommended
fragments. Treat the local constitution as selectable only when
`constitution-is-placeholder.sh` exits with code `1`. Include distributed
sub-constitutions only when `distributed_sub_constitutions` is `true` in the
config.

**1a.4 — Present the selection list and collect the selection**

Build and present the numbered selection list exactly as in
`/speckit.charter.config` Steps 4–5, with `|R|` (registry) / `|L|` (local)
source tags:

```
[FRAGMENTS]
   |R| (MANDATORY) <mandatory fragments — no number>
1. |R| (RECOMMENDED) <recommended fragments>
2. |R| <regular fragments>
[SUB-CONSTITUTIONS]
3. |R| <registry sub-constitutions>
4. |L| <distributed sub-constitutions>   ← only if enabled, marked (detected)
[OTHER]
5. |L| <CURRENT PROJECT CONSTITUTION>   ← only if a non-placeholder constitution exists

Sources:
[R]: Registry
[L]: Local
```

Rules:
- Mandatory fragments are always included and are not numbered.
- Recommended, regular fragments, registry sub-constitutions, distributed
  sub-constitutions, and the current constitution share one sequential numbering
  starting at 1.
- Distributed sub-constitutions are shown by package path (e.g. `packages/back`)
  and only when the feature is enabled.
- Placeholder constitutions are NOT offered.

Ask the user to select items. Accepted formats: space-separated (`1 2 3`),
comma-separated (`1, 2, 3`), dot-separated (`1. 2. 3.`), ranges
(`from 3 to 6 plus 8`, `1-4, 7`). Only selected numbers are included; mandatory
fragments are always included regardless of selection.

**This fragment selection is the only required user input for the fallback
flow.**

**1a.5 — Save the composition state**

Assemble the state YAML (fragments, sub_constitutions,
distributed_sub_constitutions, local_constitution, and the stripped
local_constitution_content) exactly as in `/speckit.charter.config` Step 6.

Get the stripped local constitution content (only if the user selected
`<CURRENT PROJECT CONSTITUTION>`):

```bash
bash .specify/extensions/charter/scripts/bash/constitution-strip-local.sh
```

**ID format rules for state YAML:**
- Fragment IDs: registry path without `.md` (e.g. `global/compliance`)
- Registry sub-constitution IDs: `sub-constitutions/<filename_without_md>` (e.g. `sub-constitutions/packages_auth`)
- Distributed sub-constitution IDs: `<package_path>/.charter/constitution` (e.g. `packages/auth/.charter/constitution`)

Write the assembled YAML to the state file (content via stdin):

```bash
bash .specify/extensions/charter/scripts/bash/state-write.sh "$(pwd)" << 'STATEEOF'
<GENERATED_YAML_CONTENT>
STATEEOF
```

**1a.6 — Show the composition summary (informational, NO confirmation)**

Compute the total size from the saved state:

```bash
bash .specify/extensions/charter/scripts/bash/compose-size-check.sh "$(pwd)"
```

Display the composition summary in the standard format:

```
========= FINAL PROJECT CONSTITUTION =========
[FRAGMENT] |R| <fragment_name_1>
[FRAGMENT] |R| <fragment_name_2>
[SUB-CONSTITUTION] |R| <sub_constitution_name_1>
[SUB-CONSTITUTION] |L| <package_path_1>
[OTHER] |L| <CURRENT PROJECT CONSTITUTION>
===============================================

Sources:
[R]: Registry
[L]: Local
```

- Show the `[OTHER] |L| <CURRENT PROJECT CONSTITUTION>` line ONLY if the user
  selected that number.
- Each `[FRAGMENT]`/`[SUB-CONSTITUTION]` line appears only if its number was
  selected; mandatory fragments always appear. Registry items are tagged `|R|`;
  distributed sub-constitutions and the current constitution are tagged `|L|`.
- If `compose-size-check.sh` reports `EXCEEDS_32K=true`, show the size warning.

**Do NOT ask for yes/no/cancel confirmation.**

Then continue to **Step 2** to perform the composition. Do not display the
"settings saved / run /speckit.charter.compose" message from the standalone
config command — composition proceeds immediately in this combined flow.

### Step 2: Create Backup

Before any modification, back up the existing constitution. The script writes a
timestamped copy to `.specify/charter/backups/` (and no-ops if there's no
constitution yet), printing the backup path:

```bash
bash .specify/extensions/charter/scripts/bash/constitution-backup.sh "$(pwd)"
```

### Step 3: Detect Current Mode

Read the existing constitution and check for section markers:

```bash
bash .specify/extensions/charter/scripts/bash/constitution-parse.sh
```

`constitution-parse.sh` prints `FILE_EXISTS=true|false`, `HAS_SECTIONS=true|false`,
and the list of section names found.

**Determine the mode:**

- **CREATION MODE**: If no section markers are found (new project or non-charter constitution). Go to **Step 5**.
- **OVERRIDE MODE**: If section markers ARE found (previously composed constitution). Go to **Step 4**.

### Step 4: Override Mode — Detect Local Modifications

In override mode, compare each **fragment** section in the current constitution against the saved snapshots to detect manual edits.

> **Sub-constitutions are cacheless.** Registry sub-constitutions and distributed
> sub-constitutions are NOT snapshotted and are re-read fresh from their source
> on every compose. They are therefore never reported as "modified" and are
> always regenerated from their latest content.

`snapshot-detect-modified.sh` reads the fragment list from `state.yml`, diffs
each fragment section against its snapshot, and reports the result:

```bash
bash .specify/extensions/charter/scripts/bash/snapshot-detect-modified.sh "$(pwd)"
```

It prints `MODIFIED=true` followed by one `MODIFIED_SECTION=<name>` line per
changed section, or `MODIFIED=false`.

**If modifications are detected (`MODIFIED=true`):**

Display a warning:

```
⚠️ WARNING: The following sections have been modified since the last composition:
  - <section_name_1>
  - <section_name_2>

Recomposing will OVERWRITE these modifications with the registry versions.

Options:
  - Enter "yes" to proceed and overwrite all modifications
  - Enter "no" to cancel
  - To update only specific fragments, cancel and run:
    /speckit.charter.compose update <FRAGMENT_NAME>
```

- If user answers **"no"**: Stop execution with a cancellation message.
- If user answers **"yes"**: Proceed to Step 5.

**Also in Override Mode — Update local constitution in state:**

Before proceeding, if the constitution contains a `<!-- [PROJECT SPECIFIC] SECTION -->` marker, extract its current content and update the `local_constitution_content` in the state file. This ensures the latest local constitution edits are always preserved:

```bash
bash .specify/extensions/charter/scripts/bash/constitution-extract.sh "PROJECT SPECIFIC" .specify/memory/constitution.md
```

Write the extracted content back into `local_constitution_content` via `state-write.sh`.

### Step 5: Resolve Content Sources

Determine whether to use registry versions or snapshot versions for each **fragment**.

> **Sub-constitutions are always read fresh** (cacheless), regardless of mode:
> - Registry sub-constitutions → read from the registry with `fragment-read.sh`.
> - Distributed sub-constitutions → read from the package's local file with
>   `distributed-read.sh`.
>
> This guarantees a plain `/speckit.charter.compose` picks up the latest content
> of every sub-constitution without any `update` step, while fragments keep using
> their snapshots unless explicitly updated.

**Parse the arguments to determine sub-mode (fragments only):**

**If arguments contain `update`:**
- **UPDATE MODE**: Fetch latest fragment versions from the registry and save new snapshots.
- If a specific fragment name follows `update` (e.g., `update global/compliance`), only update THAT fragment — leave all others using their current snapshot versions. (Sub-constitutions ignore `update` since they are always fresh; if the given name is a sub-constitution, a plain compose already refreshes it.)

**If no `update` argument AND we're in Override Mode (HAS_SECTIONS=true):**
- **RECREATION MODE**: Use previously saved snapshots for fragments. Check which fragments in the state are missing a snapshot:

```bash
bash .specify/extensions/charter/scripts/bash/snapshot-list-missing.sh "$(pwd)"
```

It prints `MISSING_SNAPSHOTS=true` followed by one `MISSING=<name>` line per
missing snapshot, or `MISSING_SNAPSHOTS=false`.

If snapshots are missing, warn the user:

```
⚠️ WARNING: Snapshots are missing for the following fragments:
  - <fragment_name>

These will be fetched from the latest registry version.
Proceed? (yes/no)
```

- **no**: Stop execution.
- **yes**: Use registry versions for missing fragments, snapshots for the rest.

**If no `update` argument AND we're in Creation Mode (HAS_SECTIONS=false):**
- **CREATION MODE**: Fetch all fragments from the registry and save snapshots.

### Step 6: Build Constitution Content

For UPDATE MODE with a specific fragment name, refresh the registry cache and read ONLY that fragment. Its type is known from the list in `state.yml` it belongs to.

When the target is a registry sub-constitution, its state ID has the form `sub-constitutions/<name>`. Strip the prefix before calling `fragment-read.sh`:

```bash
# Refresh the registry cache (no-op for local path registries)
bash .specify/extensions/charter/scripts/bash/registry-fetch.sh "$(pwd)" >/dev/null

# Fragment: <TYPE> = fragment
bash .specify/extensions/charter/scripts/bash/fragment-read.sh "<FRAGMENT_NAME>" "fragment" "$(pwd)"

# Registry sub-constitution: strip "sub-constitutions/" prefix first
# SC_ID from state: "sub-constitutions/packages_auth" → NAME = "packages_auth"
bash .specify/extensions/charter/scripts/bash/fragment-read.sh "<NAME>" "sub-constitution" "$(pwd)"
```

For full compose (CREATION or RECREATION MODE), read ALL fragments and sub-constitutions and build the complete constitution content.

For each **fragment** listed in `state.yml`, read the content from:
- **CREATION MODE / UPDATE MODE** — the registry: `fragment-read.sh <NAME> fragment "$(pwd)"`
- **RECREATION MODE** — the snapshot: `snapshot-read.sh <NAME> fragment "$(pwd)"` (exit code `2` means the snapshot is missing; fall back to `fragment-read.sh`)

For each **registry sub-constitution** listed in `sub_constitutions`, ALWAYS read the latest content from the registry (cacheless — no snapshot fallback).

The state stores IDs as `sub-constitutions/<name>`. Strip the `sub-constitutions/` prefix to get the filename passed to `fragment-read.sh`:

```bash
bash .specify/extensions/charter/scripts/bash/registry-fetch.sh "$(pwd)" >/dev/null
# SC_ID from state: "sub-constitutions/packages_auth" → NAME = "packages_auth"
bash .specify/extensions/charter/scripts/bash/fragment-read.sh "<NAME>" "sub-constitution" "$(pwd)"
```

For each **distributed sub-constitution** listed in `distributed_sub_constitutions`, ALWAYS read the latest content from the package's local file (cacheless).

The state stores IDs as `<package_path>/.charter/constitution`. Strip the `/.charter/constitution` suffix to get the package path passed to `distributed-read.sh`:

```bash
# DSC_ID from state: "packages/auth/.charter/constitution" → PACKAGE_PATH = "packages/auth"
bash .specify/extensions/charter/scripts/bash/distributed-read.sh "<PACKAGE_PATH>" "$(pwd)"
```

### Step 7: Save Snapshots

For CREATION MODE and UPDATE MODE, save snapshots of all **fragments** being used. `snapshot-save.sh` copies the current registry version into the snapshot store:

```bash
# For each fragment used:
bash .specify/extensions/charter/scripts/bash/snapshot-save.sh "<FRAGMENT_NAME>" "fragment" "$(pwd)"
```

> Do NOT snapshot sub-constitutions (registry or distributed). They are cacheless
> and re-read fresh on every compose.
>
> **IMPORTANT**: Snapshots always store the **original** registry content, with the
> heading levels as authored. The heading normalization (see Step 8) is applied
> only to the final constitution output — snapshots are never modified.

### Step 8: Prepare Prompt for /speckit.constitution

Build a complete prompt for `/speckit.constitution` that contains ALL the content to write. The prompt must instruct the constitution command to write the file with the exact content and section markers.

**CRITICAL: The prompt must include typed section markers as HTML comments.**

#### Heading Normalization

Before assembling each section into the final constitution, **normalize its heading levels** so that the top-level heading in every section becomes H2 (`##`). This prevents heading conflicts with the Spec Kit-generated H1 title at the top of the constitution, and ensures consistent heading depth regardless of how the fragment author chose to indent their headings.

**Use the shared script** — pipe each section's raw content through it:

```bash
NORMALIZED_CONTENT="$(printf '%s' "$RAW_CONTENT" | bash .specify/extensions/charter/scripts/bash/heading-normalize.sh 2)"
```

The script handles all edge cases correctly, including fence-aware heading detection (see below). Do not reimplement the algorithm inline.

**Key behaviours of `heading-normalize.sh`:**

1. **Fence tracking** — lines inside fenced code blocks (` ``` ` or `~~~`) are **never treated as headings**, even if they start with `#`. This covers shell/Python/YAML comments, shebangs, `#include`, and any other `#`-prefixed syntax inside code samples. Fence state is toggled on each ` ``` ` or `~~~` line.

2. **Minimum-level detection** — the script scans only *outside-fence* lines that start with one or more `#` followed by a space to find `min_level`.

3. **Delta application** — `delta = target - min_level` is applied to every outside-fence heading line. Headings are clamped at a minimum of `#` (H1). Non-heading lines and code-block contents are passed through verbatim.

4. **No-op when no headings** — if the content has no heading lines outside fenced blocks, it is emitted unchanged.

**Important constraints:**
- Apply normalization only to the content used in the final constitution — **never modify registry files, snapshot files, or the distributed package files**.
- The prefix line `WHEN WORKING ON …` added before sub-constitution content is not a heading and must not be modified — pipe only the fragment/sub-constitution body, then prepend the prefix line to the normalized result.
- Normalization is independent per section — each section's headings are shifted relative to its own minimum, not a global minimum.

#### Typed Section Comment Format

Use typed tags in section markers to identify the kind of content:

| Content type | Tag | Example marker |
|---|---|---|
| Fragment | `[F]` | `<!-- [F] global/compliance SECTION -->` |
| Registry sub-constitution | `[SC]` | `<!-- [SC] sub-constitutions/packages_auth SECTION -->` |
| Distributed sub-constitution | `[DSC]` | `<!-- [DSC] packages/auth/.charter/constitution SECTION -->` |
| Project-specific (local) | `[PS]` | `<!-- [PS] PROJECT SPECIFIC SECTION -->` |

#### Prefix Line for Sub-constitutions

For **registry sub-constitutions**: derive the working-on path from the state ID by stripping the `sub-constitutions/` prefix and replacing every `_` in the filename stem with `/`. Use `-` freely within a path segment for readability (e.g. `packages_auth-gateway` → `packages/auth-gateway`).

Example: state ID `sub-constitutions/packages_auth` → prefix line `WHEN WORKING ON packages/auth, FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS:`

For **distributed sub-constitutions**: derive the working-on path from the state ID by stripping the `/.charter/constitution` suffix.

Example: state ID `packages/auth/.charter/constitution` → prefix line `WHEN WORKING ON packages/auth, FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS:`

#### Final Constitution Structure

The structure of the final `constitution.md` MUST be:

```
<!-- [F] <FRAGMENT_NAME_1> SECTION -->
<HEADING_NORMALIZED_CONTENT_OF_FRAGMENT_1>

<!-- [F] <FRAGMENT_NAME_2> SECTION -->
<HEADING_NORMALIZED_CONTENT_OF_FRAGMENT_2>

<!-- [SC] sub-constitutions/<SC_NAME_1> SECTION -->
WHEN WORKING ON <working_on_path_1>, FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS:
<HEADING_NORMALIZED_CONTENT_OF_SUB_CONSTITUTION_1>

<!-- [DSC] <PACKAGE_PATH_1>/.charter/constitution SECTION -->
WHEN WORKING ON <PACKAGE_PATH_1>, FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS:
<HEADING_NORMALIZED_CONTENT_OF_DISTRIBUTED_SUB_CONSTITUTION_1>

<!-- [PS] PROJECT SPECIFIC SECTION -->
<CONTENT_OF_LOCAL_CONSTITUTION>
```

**Rules for the prompt:**
- Each section starts with its typed HTML comment marker on its own line
- Fragment section IDs use the registry path (e.g., `global/compliance`, `languages/typescript/standards`)
- Registry sub-constitution section IDs use `sub-constitutions/<filename_stem>` (e.g., `sub-constitutions/packages_auth`)
- Distributed sub-constitution section IDs use `<package_path>/.charter/constitution` (e.g., `packages/auth/.charter/constitution`)
- The `WHEN WORKING ON …` prefix line appears immediately after the section marker for both registry and distributed sub-constitutions, using the derived working-on path (not the full state ID)
- The local constitution section uses the `[PS]` tag and `PROJECT SPECIFIC` as ID
- The local constitution content is from the state file's `local_constitution_content` field (it preserves the author's heading levels — no normalization applied)
- Section markers are crucial for subsequent override/update detection — preserve them exactly
- Do NOT include any placeholder tokens — all content must be concrete
- The order must be: fragments first (in the order from state.yml), then registry sub-constitutions, then distributed sub-constitutions, then project-specific

Build the prompt as a **string in memory** (do NOT save it to a file). The prompt should be:

```
Write the following content as the project constitution. This is a composed constitution from charter fragments. Preserve the exact section markers (HTML comments) as they are essential for future updates. Do not add, remove, or modify any section markers. Write the content exactly as provided below, maintaining all formatting. The typed section comments (<!-- [F] NAME SECTION -->, <!-- [SC] NAME SECTION -->, <!-- [DSC] NAME SECTION -->, <!-- [PS] PROJECT SPECIFIC SECTION -->) MUST be preserved exactly as shown.

<FULL_CONSTITUTION_CONTENT_WITH_SECTION_MARKERS>
```

### Step 9: Execute /speckit.constitution

Execute the `/speckit.constitution` command with the prepared prompt.

**IMPORTANT**: The invocation method depends on the agent/integration:
- In Copilot/Claude: invoke `/speckit.constitution <prompt>`
- The full content must be passed as the argument

After execution, the `/speckit.constitution` command will write the constitution file and add its own Spec Kit metadata (Sync Impact Report comment at top, version/ratified/amended line at bottom). This is expected and correct.

### Step 10: Validate Output

After `/speckit.constitution` completes, validate the generated constitution.
`constitution-validate-sections.sh` derives the expected sections from `state.yml`
(fragments + sub-constitutions + the PROJECT SPECIFIC section when a local
constitution is included) and verifies each has a section marker:

```bash
bash .specify/extensions/charter/scripts/bash/constitution-validate-sections.sh "$(pwd)"
```

It prints `VALID=true` on success, or `VALID=false` with one `MISSING=<name>`
line per absent section (and exits non-zero). Surface any missing sections to the
user and suggest re-running the compose command.

### Step 11: Display Result

If validation passes:

```
✅ Composed constitution successfully generated and compliant with configuration.

ℹ️  If the generated constitution is not valid, you can restore the previous
    constitution by running /speckit.charter.restore
```

If validation has warnings, display them and suggest running the compose command again.

For UPDATE MODE with a single fragment, also confirm:

```
✅ Fragment "<FRAGMENT_NAME>" updated successfully in the constitution.
```

## Notes

- Backups are stored in `.specify/charter/backups/` with timestamps
- Snapshots are stored in `.specify/charter/snapshots/` organized by type — **only fragments are snapshotted**
- Registry sub-constitutions and distributed sub-constitutions are **cacheless**: their latest content is read on every compose, so a plain `/speckit.charter.compose` refreshes all of them (no `update` needed). Package owners can edit `<package>/.charter/constitution.md` and re-run compose to propagate changes
- **Heading normalization**: compose automatically shifts each section's top heading to H2, preserving internal relative depth. This never modifies registry files, snapshot files, or distributed package files — only the assembled constitution output is normalized.
- **Snapshot comparison ignores heading levels**: `snapshot-compare.sh` strips leading `#` characters before diffing, so auto-indent does not trigger false "modified" warnings.
- **State ID formats**: fragment IDs are their registry path (`global/compliance`); registry sub-constitution IDs include the `sub-constitutions/` prefix (`sub-constitutions/packages_auth`); distributed sub-constitution IDs include the full source path (`packages/auth/.charter/constitution`).
- **Sub-constitution prefix lines**: for registry sub-constitutions, the working-on path is derived by stripping `sub-constitutions/` and replacing `_` with `/` in the stem. For distributed sub-constitutions, the working-on path is the package root (strip `/.charter/constitution` from the ID).
- The local constitution content in the state file is updated each time compose runs in override mode
- Typed section markers (`<!-- [F] NAME SECTION -->`, `<!-- [SC] NAME SECTION -->`, `<!-- [DSC] NAME SECTION -->`, `<!-- [PS] PROJECT SPECIFIC SECTION -->`) are the backbone of the update mechanism — never remove or alter them manually
- The `/speckit.constitution` command adds its own metadata (Sync Impact Report, version line) — this is expected and should not be confused with charter sections
