# distributed-read.sh — Read a distributed sub-constitution's content
# Usage: distributed-read.sh <PACKAGE_PATH> [PROJECT_ROOT]
#
# PACKAGE_PATH is the package directory relative to the project root
# (e.g. "packages/back"). Reads "<PACKAGE_PATH>/.charter/constitution.md".
#
# Distributed sub-constitutions are cacheless: this always reads the current
# on-disk file so package owners can update their rules and have them picked up
# on the next compose without any snapshot/update step.
